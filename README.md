# BoU Roads

This is the project for the Interactive Graphics course at Sapienza. It is a 3D game developed using HTML and ThreeJS library. ThreeJS is a cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The game is to collect as many coins as possible trying to avoid the various cars, trucks, and animals on the road. This concept explain also the name of the game: ”BoU Roads”, which stands for Bald of Ubalds Roads, tries to reproduce what happens in the Roman road Baldo Degli Ubaldi when you try to cross (:D).

## How to play

Let’s see in detail how BoU roads work. 
Our hero can be controlled easily with the ”W-A-S-D” keyboard scheme, pressing space he jumps and finally can toggle Walk/Run with ”shift”. Those fundamentals movements are required to avoid the traffic and the wilderness of this messy road, in particular, the hero it’s a pirate whose intention is to get as many coins as he can. Collecting coins is not so simple, because the difficulties of modern days are behind the corner. Only a coin spawns at a time, and it’s generated randomly to be always visible but not always reachable, indeed sometimes the hero must jump to reach it. Every time a coin is collected, the game increase in difficulty, and a boar or a bird get spawned (which are not present in the first stage of the game).
